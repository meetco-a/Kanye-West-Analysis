[Post-Chorus: Travis Scott]
I got that gold stuff stuck on my back

[Bridge: Drake]
Now I see

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
¿Cómo eres? Subale
Come on in I'm super paid
Song for song I'm dubaday
Just got off now I'm suitless
Watch how you talk to me
Now I need y'all to hear this
I need a 100 racks
That's just my talking fee
Just playin'
I'm just sayin' a lotta niggas
Ain't been lost as me
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Can you be? (way up)

Oh baby, down to make me

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I caught a wave
Caught more air in a super day
Call Aaliyah, I'm super paid
Jet lag, and tryna recuperate
Just got off the flight from Budapest
Don't need Khaled, just say "you the best!"
You the type of nigga to shop at Uniqlo
Just found out my father-in-law unisex
Running out of money, running into debt
Running from bill collectors, I ain't pay them yet
Shit you did, with no matter how rich you get
And even more, depending on the bitch you get
I be getting worried for my niggas getting married, seriously
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Can you be? (way up)
Can you be? (way up)
Can you be? (way up)
Can you be? (way up)
Can you be? (way up)
Will you be? (way up)
Can you be? (way up)
Can you be? (way up)
[Post-Chorus: Travis Scott]
I got that gold stuff stuck on my back
I got that now I can't get that back
[Bridge: Drake]
Now I see
Now I see
Now I see
Now I see
Now I see
Now I see
Now I see
Now I see
Now I see
