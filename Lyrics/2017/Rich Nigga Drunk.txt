[Chorus: Kanye West]
She under the influence
Keep doin' what you been doin'
Keep doin' what you been doin'
Keep doin' what you been doin'
She under the influence
She rich nigga drunk
A broke nigga text her
She roll her eyes like, What this nigga want?
She under the influence
Keep doin' what you been doin'
Keep doin' what you been doin'
Keep doin' what you been doin'
[Verse 1: Tyga]
She under my influence
She rich nigga drunk
All you got is chump change
'Cause you been with a chump
You should be on Punk
'Cause you been with a punk
I been ballin' all year, yeah

Let's spend a weekend in the TRUMP
We can get rich nigga drunk
Drink up everything in the minibar
To make you call to fill it up
Yeah, that's that rich nigga drunk
She say she sick of gettin' up

Barely got time to fix her lunch
We'll come get rich nigga drunk
Kiss my dick, kiss it once
Okay, just one kiss
This time with a little tongue
Woo, she rich nigga drunk
Gon' let a rich nigga fuck
Said she never been a quitter
But she finna give it up, agh
[Chorus: Kanye West]
She under the influence
Keep doin' what you been doin'

She rich nigga drunk
A broke nigga text her
She roll her eyes like, What this nigga want?
She under the influence
Keep doin' what you been doin'
Keep doin' what you been doin'
Keep doin' what you been doin'
