Your love is fadin'
Your love is fadin'
Your love is fadin'
Know it ain't no wrong
I feel it's fadin'
I think I think too much
I feel it's fadin'
Ain't nobody watchin'
I feel it's fadin'
I just fade away
I feel it...
I feel it...
I feel it's fadin'
I think I think too much

Roll up, roll up
Hold up, hold up
Po' up, po' up

Work the middle 'til it hurt a little
(I feel it)

I feel it's fadin'
Ain't nobody watchin'

Whole world on my dick
