Yeah, I see you waitin' over there
See you jockin' over there
See you lookin' at my girl over here
Why worry bout the girl over here
Keep your eyes over there
It is creepy when you stare
Hey, I see you waitin' over there
See you jockin' over there
Thinkin' about your own life
Why you talkin' 'bout the young, you dig?
I'm just doin' my thing
If you know what I mean, get it right
And they think they know
And they think know the deal, for real
I'm just doin' my thing
If you know what I mean, get it right
And they think they know
And they think know the deal, for real
I'm just doin' my thing
If you know what I mean, yo
I don't love who I am so I'm workin' on a fix
I don't need a bitch trying to tear my mind on my grip
If I had one wish it'd be to have more wishes, duh
Fuck tryna make it rhyme throw them stones, with your bitch ass
Cutting me deep and even though I bleed I stand alone
Alone I'll be, heart of a lion still shining on your sucka ass
Work it, work it, work it, for inner peace
Fightin' for the freedom of my soul, I can hear the speech
Yeah I mumble while I'm trippin on so many pills
Hah, they figured that, they know I'm ill
Yeah, I see you waitin' over there
See you jockin' over there
See you lookin' at my girl over here
Why worry bout this girl over here
Keep your eyes over there
It is creepy when you stare
Hey, I see you waitin' over there
See you jockin' over there
Thinkin' about your own life
Why you talkin' 'bout the young, you dig?
I'm just doin' my thing
If you know what I mean, get it right
And they think they know
Any they think know the deal, for real
I'm just doin' my thing
If you know what I mean, get it right
And they think they know
And they think know the deal, for real
I'm just doin' my thing
If you know what I mean, yo
