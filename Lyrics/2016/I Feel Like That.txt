While you're fast asleep, do you experience nervousness or shakiness inside, weakness or dizziness? The idea that so much can control your thoughts. Lost in your thoughts. Trouble remembering things, feeling easily annoyed and irritated. Afraid of open spaces, going in public. Thoughts of ending your life. Feelings that most people could not be trusted before I had that type of heart, chest pains?
I feel like this
I feel like that
I feel like that
I feel like that all the time
I feel like that
I feel like that
I feel like that
Feel like that all the time
Do you feel tempered outbursts, that you cannot control? Feeling lonely, even when you are with people, feeling locked. Feeling a little sad, feeling disinterested in things, feeling fearful. Are your feelings easily hurt? Remember that people are unfriendly, or do you feel like people dislike you?
I feel like that
I feel like that
I feel like that
I feel like that all the time
I feel like that
I feel like that
I feel like that
Feel like that all the time
Do you have trouble falling asleep? Nausea, upset stomach, pop those pills? Numbness, tingling across your body, trouble catchin' your breath?
I feel like that
I feel like that
I feel like that all the time
I feel like that
I feel like that
Feel like that all the time
