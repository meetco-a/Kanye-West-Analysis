[Intro: Kanye West]
We all go
Not just by myself, looking for nigga's like where's Waldo
She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped them at Aldo
Modern day MJ with an off the wall flow
[Hook: Sampha]
Flying, flying, flying overseas
Everywhere and in between
...And you're looking in the church and you're messed up
Wondering why your dawgs don't say hi
I've been looking in the church and you're messed up
And you wonder why it's gone in the nightlife
Yeah they're looking in the church
Wondering why your dawgs don't say hi
I've been looking in the church and you're messed up
And you wonder why it's gone in the nightlife
[?]
You've been treating me like I'm [?]
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I can't say no to nobody
Know you're nobody
And at this rate we gon' both die broke
Got friends that ask for money knowin' I'm in debt
And like my wife said, I still didn't say no
People tryna say I'm goin' crazy on Twitter
My friends' best advice was to stay low
The media said it was outlandish then
The media said he's way out of control
I just feel like I'm the only one that compares
I'm not out of control just not in their control
I know I'm the most influential
That TIME cover was just confirmation
This generation's closest thing to Einstein
So don't worry about me, I'm fine
I can see a thousand years from now in real life
Shit on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like
[?] conventional thoughts, don't even question
I know [?] get a blessin'
[?] lecture, be down with the mission
[?] with no permissions, on our own conditions
Most [?]
Yeezy with the [?], get it way different
Never listen to Hollywood producers
Don't stare at money too long, it's [?]
The OG [?] had survived
I wasn't supposed to make it past 25
[Hook: Sampha]
...And you're looking in the church and you're messed up
Wondering why your dawgs don't say hi
I've been looking in the church and you're messed up
And you wonder why it's gone in the nightlife
Yeah they're looking in the church
Wondering why your dawgs don't say hi
I've been looking in the church and you're messed up
And you wonder why it's gone in the nightlife
[?]
You've been treating me like I'm [?]
[Verse 2]
I've been [?] more to come
[?] over the drums
I believe in the children
Listen to the kids, bro
[?] sat back and smiled
[?] black on black crime
[?] make a dime
Most black men couldn't balance a checkbook
But buy a new car, talkin' 'bout how my neck look
Well it all looks paid for
Hundred [?]
I am one with the people
I am one with the people
I've been [?]
Checkin' Instagram, promise to crowdsource my self esteem
