[Kirk Franklin]
Father
This prayer is for everyone that feels they're not good enough This prayer's for everybody that feels they're too messed up
For everyone that feels they've said "I'm sorry" too many times
Let them know that's why you took the nail
So we could have eternal life
If all God's children would get down on their knees and pray
And give up all of those things that pull our hearts away
You will forgive all of our wrong and make us brand new again
But I won't make it, God, if you let go of my hand
That's why we need more (faith!)
Yes, I'm searching for you, I'm looking for (more!)
Yes I am, in Your arms is where I feel (safe!)
They're killing our babies in the streets, I call out for (war!)
I need just a little bit more of some (faith!)
Just a mustard seed, I'm looking for You for (more!)
Prayer for our homes and our families
We just wanna be (safe!)
Can't you hear the trumpet sound, I think I hear (war!)
