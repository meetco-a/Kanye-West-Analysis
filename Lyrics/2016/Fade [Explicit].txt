You're love is fading...
You're love is fading...
You're love is fading...
I feel it fade
When no one ain't around
I feel it fade
I think I think too much
I feel it fade
When ain't nobody watchin'
I feel it fade
I just fade away
I feel it...
Fade away
I feel it...
I feel it...
Fade away-ay-ay-ay
I think I think too much
I feel it...
Your love is fading
I feel it...
Roll up, roll up
Hold up, hold up
Po' up, po' up
I feel it
I love to
I wanna
I'm tryna
I feel it
I'm a rock the boat
Work the middle 'til it hurt a little
I feel it
Your love is fading
I feel it
Fucking with a real ass nigga
I feel it
Fuck how you feel ass nigga
I feel it
Bitch better act like you know better
I feel it
Woah...
When no one ain't around
I feel it fade
I think I think too much
I feel it fade
Ain't nobody watchin'
I feel it fade
I just fade away
I feel it fade
You don't even know
I've been so far gone
I feel it
I've been so led on
I've been running 'round
I feel it
I've been on my shit
Whole world on my dick
I feel it
I just need to know
I can feel it
Oh, deep inside
Deep, deep, I'm inside
I feel it
Yes, deep inside
Deep, deep, I'm inside
I feel it
Oh, deep inside
Deep, deep, I'm inside
I feel it
Yes, deep inside
Deep, deep, I'm inside
I can feel it
Oh, deep inside
Deep, deep, I'm inside
I feel it
Yes, deep inside
Deep, deep, I'm inside
I feel it
Oh, deep inside
Deep, deep, I'm inside
I feel it
Yes, deep inside
Deep, deep, I'm inside
I feel it fade
Oh, I get lifted, yes
I feel it fade
I feel it fade
I feel it
I feel it fade
