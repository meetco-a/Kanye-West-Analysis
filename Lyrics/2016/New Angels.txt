[Hook]
New angels still learning how to fly
Still learning how to fly
And lay your love on the line
New angels
Who will make the sacrifice?
Who will make the sacrifice?
And lay your love on the line
[Verse 1]
Forget everything that you know
You're way too far from home
Hollow sign for kingdom
And you're ready, you're ready, you're ready
To hold on to [?]
Having to run the game over
She ready, she ready, she ready
[Hook]
The new angel
Still learning how to fly
Still learning how to fly
And lay your love on the line
New angel
Who will make the sacrifice?
Who will make the sacrifice?
And lay your love on the line
[Verse 2]
Hollow [?] for kingdom
Hell if I, hell if I know
Love and the [?]
Act like you've met me before
Sweater that she met him before
Had a menage a trois
Now that she ready, she ready
Yeah she ready, ready, ready
And you knew she was
And you knew she was
You knew it
Before you slip that [?] in her drink
Yeah you knew she was
Yeah you knew she was
You knew it
[Outro]
They got a special place in hell for guys like us
They got a special place in hell for guys like us
They got a special place in hell for guys like us
Guys like us, guys like us, guys like us
They got a special place in hell for guys like us
