You keep it going man, you keep those books rolling
You pick up those books you're going to read
And not remember, and you roll man
You get that associate's degree, okay,
Then you get your bachelor's, then you get your master's
Then you get your master's masters,
Then you get your doctorate
You go man, then when everybody says quit
You show them those degrees man
When everybody says, "hey, you're not working,"
"You're not making any money"
You say, "look at my degrees and you look at my life,
Yeah, I'm 52, so what?
Hate all you want
But I'm smart, I'm so smart, and I'm in school"
And these guys are out here making
Money all these ways, and I'm spending mine to be smart
You know why?
Because when I die, buddy,
You know what's gonna keep me warm?
That's right, those degrees
