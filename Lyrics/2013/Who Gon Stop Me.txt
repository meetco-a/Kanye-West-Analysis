I'm a legend in the makin'
All these suckas they hatin'
Cuz it's been a long time
I'm just tryin' to get mine
I'm a legend in the makin'
All these suckas they hatin'
Cuz it's been a long time
I'm just tryin' to get mine
I was born in '89
Got the hustle in my mind
I'm the first to be the baddest
Up the ladder, I will climb
I feel strong, the world is mine
Learnin' from Al Pachino
Then I flip 'em like a kilo
Oh, no wait a minute man
I feel those haters giving dirty looks
Mad cuz I be the one that got them other rappers sI make them cook like a turkey in the oven
And I'm knockin' suckas out when they pushin' and they shovin
I'll never stop until I'm a motherfuckin' hip hop god,
You niggas get slammed like pogs
I'm a [??]
Born in the woods niggas
So you know I'm a beast
New shark in the water
And I'm looking for a feast
It's a new year, a new day,
A new month, a new week
Feelin' really legendary off these Baby Boss beats
This game needs a new face to look up to
And I'ma start arraigning niggas I wanna step up to
I'm a legend in the makin'
All these suckas they hatin'
Cuz it's been a long time
I'm just tryin' to get mine
I'm a legend in the makin'
All these suckas they hatin'
Cuz it's been a long time
I'm just tryin' to get mine
It's been a long ass road
It's been a long time coming
I been searching the blocks, tryin' to get this money
And I don't do it for the loot,
I do it because I love it
These niggas doubted the flow
So I flipped it like [??] shove it
A young [??]
Coming up from Ground Zero
Tryin' to have more money than seven Robert DeNiro's
So I'm gonna check the mic
You better check the steel-o
Cuz I'm lookin sharper than a heroin addict's needle
I'm like a bullet racing towards your door
I can't stop, I won't stop
Like I said before
It's my time, better hide your glocks
[??] makin' bodies rock
And we make the ladies cry
And I always bring the heat
Like I got the Shaq Attack
(I got to get my mic)
Haters can not tell me nothin'
In the words of Rick Ross,
"Everyday we hustlin'"
Make something outta nothin
Water into wine
Drop [??]
Man, we do it all the time
I'm a legend in the makin'
All these suckas they hatin'
Cuz it's been a long time
I'm just tryin' to get mine
I'm a legend in the makin'
All these suckas they hatin'
Cuz it's been a long time
I'm just tryin' to get mine
When [??]
Swichin' up the style
Flows deeper than the Nile
Got you niggas in denial
Was crazy as a juvenile
Got my friend colluding now
Filled up with rhymes
Now I hurt you like a root canal
I got [??]
We're guerrilla
Not the monkey but military
style like Attila
Better yet, Genghis Khan
Bout to blow up like a bomb
And we're fire on the mic
About to set off the alarms
I won't stop till I have haters
All around the world
Cuz I'ma be the mac up in the club
Touchin your girl
Take a puff and watch the smoke swirl
My record's on the radio
Blastin' everyone away
Hitmakers from the vinyl yo
Homeboy get so vicious
Got a big, relentless style
Beat up any other rapper
Trying to get up and be wild
I got spinners for days
So you wanna step aside
Cuz legends is being made
I'm a legend in the makin'
All these suckas they hatin'
Cuz it's been a long time
I'm just tryin' to get mine
I'm a legend in the makin'
All these suckas they hatin'
Cuz it's been a long time
I'm just tryin' to get mine
I'm a legend in the makin'
All these suckas they hatin'
Cuz it's been a long time
I'm just tryin' to get mine
I'm a legend in the makin'
All these suckas they hatin'
Cuz it's been a long time
I'm just tryin' to get mine
