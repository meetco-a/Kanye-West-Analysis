[Intro: Sway & Kanye]
Why don't you empower yourself and don't need them and do it yourself?
How Sway?
Take a few steps back to...
[Hook]
You ain't got the answers man
You ain't got the answers
You ain't got the answers Sway
I been doing this more than you
You ain't got the answers man
You ain't got the answers
You ain't got the answers Sway
(I'm asking you for the answers!)
You ain't got the answers man
You ain't got the answers
You ain't got the answers Sway
I been doing this more than you
You ain't got the answers man
You ain't got the answers
You ain't got the answers Sway
You ain't been doing the education
[Verse 1]
I am Shakespeare in the flesh
Walt Disney, Nike, Google
Let me create more
Or do you want to marginalize me til I'm out of my moment?
I am the number 1 most impactful artist of our generation
You ain't got the answers man
(You ain't gotta turn up man ain't no fucking show man)
You ain't spent 13 million dollars of your own trying to empower yourself
What's the name of your clothing line? We don't know
[Hook]
[Outro]
Why don't you empower yourself and don't need them and do it yourself?
How Sway?
Take a few steps back to...
You ain't got the answers man
You ain't got the answers
You ain't got the answers
You ain't got the answers Sway
