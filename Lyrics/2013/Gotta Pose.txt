Kanye to the year, you heard the name
Tracks plus racks, finna murder the game
Uh, can I get it?
Uh uh uh uh uh uh
All these is believe and breathe the same air that I breathe and bleed like I bleed
Only different story, fuck that up
Iceberg flows, I gotta pose
Every whip but the studio
In the hospital dissin, flow is very sick
Plus very rich, very thick chain
Very thick til I got every bitch
20's at the bottom carry the 6
If I cock back and shot on my band with precision
You can't hate this, with the platinum braces
I rather need new teeth than a whole facelift
But she taste this, rather taste this
Taste my aiming, watch me H this
You whack rap, catch me a replacement
So I hit the basement, took it back to basics
We stand to my tims, grab my laces
Got loofs on, the only type noose on em
Define how like triple goose in it
What the fuck I gotta do? Another truth in?
See it don't really matter what yall brooling
Yall ain't satisfied til we shoot you
So if somebody gotta die tell me who want it
That Chi Town, Southside booth, we on it, we on it
