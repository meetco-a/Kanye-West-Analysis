[Verse 1]
From my theme song
My leather black jeans on
My by any means on
Pardon me gettin' my scream on
Enter the kingdom
But watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman
And at the top door they gon come at you King Kong
Middle America packed in
Came to see me in my black skin
My homey was number one draft pick
They slip on his jersey and act rich
If I don't get ran out by Catholics
Here come some conservative Baptists
Sayin he overreactin'
Like them black kids in Chiraq bitch
[Hook: 1]
4in the morning, and I'm zonin'
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where's the trojans?
Picture me livin' in the moment
And I've been a menace for the longest
Picture me livin' in the moment
Picture me livin' in the moment
[Bridge]
So follow me up cause this shit's about to go down
I'm doin' 500, I'm outta control now
But there's nowhere to go, now
And there's no way to slow down
Runnin' out of time - moving fast
So just close your eyes and then enjoy this crash
[Hook: 2]
4 in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
Think I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 girls, they're the chosen
Baby we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it
[Verse 2]
Stop all that goon shit
Early morning cartoon shit
This is goon shit
Fuck up your whole afternoon shit
I'm aware I'm a wolf
Soon as the moon hit
I'm aware I'm a king
Back out the tomb bitch
Back out the room bitch
Stop all that goon shit
These niggas ain't doin' shit
These niggas ain't doin' shit
What do you say to a masked man
This Inglorious Bastard that's rappin'
We might have to burn this whole suit down,
Like the theater that Hitler was trapped in
[Hook: 3]
4 in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
Think I'm possessed, it's an omen
300 girls, and we're throwin'
300 girls, and they're zonin'
Baby we're livin' in the moment
Baby we're livin' in the moment
Keep it goin', keep it goin'
[Bridge]
