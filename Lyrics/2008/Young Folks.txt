Plain Pat What up (owww)
Uh [x18]
I've always been the same since back in the day
Always felt like we should get paid
We are magazine or we get played
Why did he say "I don't know ask Gabe"
Now I'm on the magazines where the roses are
Poppin' champagne in that rosedon
Won a few awards then we went on tour
And yup in ma bag a whole bag of porn [haha]
Magazines hate him, then they loves him
Then they hate him (we hate him), f**k it what to say then? (f**k it)
Cover of the fader (yeah)
Now I'm on my way up
Now you want me say what? huh you want me say what?
I be talking my shit so I guess I'm a asshole.
They can kick and push like Lu Fiasco
And I guess everytime I'm just gon get in that mode
So up to the press I guess miss that vote

Read the interiew, man the whole shit wrong
Far as this shit go, you know the way I wanna go
I need Al Gore to recount that vote
You know [x4] uh [background]
You think you really know but you have no idea
You think you really know but you have no idea
You think you really know but I'm right here
You think you really know but you have no idea
And I'm gon stay the same my whole career yeah
