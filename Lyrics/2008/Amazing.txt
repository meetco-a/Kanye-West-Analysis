Everybody fired up this evening
I'm exhausted barely breathing
Holding on to what I believe in
No matter what you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see... its amazing
So amazing, so amazing
So amazing, it's amazing
So amazing, so amazing
So amazing, it's amazing
I'm a monster I'm a killer
I know I'm wrong
I'm a problem
That will never ever be solved
No matter what you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see... it's amazing
So amazing, so amazing
So amazing, it's amazing
So amazing, so amazing
So amazing, it's amazing
I'm a monster I'm a maven
I know this world is changing
Never gave in never gave up
I'm the only thing I'm afraid of
No matter what you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see... its amazing
So amazing, so amazing
So amazing, it's amazing
So amazing, so amazing
So amazing, it's amazing
So amazing, so amazing
So amazing, it's amazing
So amazing, so amazing
So amazing, it's amazing
I'm amazing yea I'm all that
If I ain't on my grind then what you call that
Victorious... yea we warriors
We make history strive off victory
Standing at my podium I'm trying to watch my sodium
Die high blood pressure either let the feds catch ya
I'm amazing born on a full moon
I was bred to get it in no spoon
That's why I'm so goose summertime no juice
Big family small house no rooms
They like oh god why he go so hard
Look what hes been through he deserve an applause
So amazing, so amazing
So amazing, it's amazing
So amazing, so amazing
So amazing, it's amazing
So amazing, so amazing
So amazing, it's amazing
So amazing, so amazing
So amazing, it's amazing
