[CHORUS:]
Go ahead'n roll it up and pass it around...
Cuz there's been a lot of bullshit going down 
A lot of soldiers they ain't make it through this year 
So let's just celebrate that we still here and 
Whooooa, never leave me alone 
Tell 'em holla atcha boy 
Cuz I'll be coming home 
I'll be coming home 
Never leave me alone 
Tell 'em holla atcha boy 
Cuz I'll be coming home 
I'll be coming 
My homie called me like, "What up, man?" 
Not from Florida, but what up, fam? 
There's been a whole lot of hating again 
And if they hating on me, damn, what up then? 
I met this girl when I was three years old 
And what I love most, she had so much soul 
She said "Excuse me little homie, I know you don't know me 
But uh, my name is Windy, and yo, I like to blow trees" and 
From that point I never blow her off 
Come from out of town, I like to show her off 
They like to act tough, she like to toe 'em off 
And make 'em straighten up they hat cuz she know they soft 
And when I grew up, she taught me how to go downtown 
And in the nighttime, her face lit up, so astounding 
I told her, in my heart is where she'll always be 
She never mess with entertainers cuz they always leave 
She said it feels like they walk and go from me 
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on tv, and told on me 
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me 
She said "'Ye, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me" 
But if you really cared for her 
Then you wouldn't've never hit the airport, and followed your dreams 
Sometimes I still talk to her 
But when I talk to her, it always seems like she talk about me 
She said, "You left your kids, and they just like you 
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you 
But they just not you, and I just got through 
Talkin' 'bout what he tryin'a do, just not new" 
Now everybody go the game figured out all wrong 
I guess you never know what you got til it's gone 
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home 
And guess when I heard that, when I was back home 
In the interview I'm representing you, making you proud 
Shoot for the stars, so when you fall you land on a cloud 
Jumpin in crowds, sparkin' lighters, wave 'em around 
If you don't know by now, I'm talkin' 'bout Chi-town
