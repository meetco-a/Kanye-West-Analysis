Wake up, Mr. West, Mr. West, Mr. Fresh
Mr. by-his-self-he-so-impressed
I mean, damn, did you even see the test?
You got D's muh'fucker, D's, Rosie Perez
And yes, barely pass any and every class
Lookin' at every ass
Cheated on every test
I guess this is my dissertation
Homie, this shit is basic
Welcome to Graduation
Good Morning

On this day we become legendary
Everything we dreamed of
I'm like a fly Malcolm X
Buy any jeans necessary
Detroit red cleaned up
From the streets of the league
From the 8th to ki'
But you graduate when you make it up out of the streets
From the moments of pain
Look how far we done came
Haters sayin' you changed
Now you doin' your thang
Good Morning
Good Morning
Good Mornian
Good Morning
Good Mornian
Look at the valedictorian scared of the future
While I hop in the Delorean
Scared-to-face-the-world complacent career student
Some people graduate, but be still stupid
They tell you read this, eat this, don't look around
Just peep this, preachers, teach us, Jesus
Okay, look up now, they done stole your streetness
After all of that, you receive this
Good Morning
Hustlers, that's if you're still livin' get on down
Every time that we hear them
Good Morning
Hustlers, that's if you're still livin' get on down
Every time that we hear them
Good Morning
Hustlers, that's if you're still livin' get on down
Every time that we hear them
Good Morning
Hustlers, that's if you're still livin' get on down
Get on down
Get, get on down
