She don't believe in shooting stars
But she believe in shoes & cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the store's department
You more like L'eau de Stardee shit
I'm more of the, trips to Florida
Order the h'orderves, views of the water
Straight from the page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man why can't life always be this easy
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy
I get a call like "Where are you Yeezy?"
And try to hit you with a 'Oeur de Whopee'
Till I get flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these nigga's got me
I hate these nigga's more than a Nazi
As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
What do I know?
Flashing lights (lights, lights, lights)
What do I know?

I know it's been a while
Sweetheart, we hardly talk, I was doing my thing
I know I was foul bay-bay
A-bay lately you been all on my brain
And if somebody would've told me a month ago
Fronting though, yo I wouldn't wanna know
If somebody would've told me a year ago
It'd go, get this difficult
Feeling like Katrina with no femur
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no Visa
First class with the seat back I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory's museum
I'm just saying, hey Mona Lisa
Come home you know you can't roam without Caesar
As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
What do I know?
