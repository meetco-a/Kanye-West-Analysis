There must be more good women than men percentage-wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimized
Thats why a lot of girls claim they arent into guys
And mess with other girls part time to improvise
I knew she wouldnt buy I see it right in her eyes
But Im like any other guy tryna get in her thighs
She tellin me bout how black people should enterprise
And Im like if you dont get your a-s in this ride from enterprise that I rented yesterday and gotta have in by 5
With the gas fully filled up like I didnt drive
I told her I had a girl but f--k it I didnt lie
This rap game is alright Im just gettin by
She had a little weed and we get a little high
And Im looking in her eyes
And Im loving her vibe
She told me back in 95 she fell in love with the tribe
Back in 92 I was just like you
Please dont be confused by the ice and jewels
Im like any other n---a my ice just stay cool
Like any other n---a that claim they hate school
And think yeah frees bangin but shes no Rachel
We ball til we fall
Hit the mall
After we hit dont call
Fill your lives with nothing but lies
And I would like to apologize
We ball til we fall
Hit the mall
After we hit dont call
Fill your lives with nothing but lies
And I would like to apologize
But you cant stand right here and tell me everythings is gonna be alright
Cuz until the day a real man stands up Im gonna have to improvise
Was it something I did wrong?
Yeah I know Im wrong
Shes at home alone and Im always gone
I hate it when shes mad but more when she passive
Now she on the internet looking for classes
Outta state though man that hurt yo
But I got work though
When Im at work yo
If she dont call a lot and when she do she pourin out her heart
You never listen to me
Then the call drop
And I promised her everything
Told her when I get a deal Ill get her a wedding ring
But when I got my deal I was back in the ring
Fighting my urges strip club splurges
Never had money so I feel like a virgin
And Im trying to break the banks cherry
Trying to see can I afford a canary (?)
With a ferrari and a dinner date with Halle Berry
When from 15 gs to 1500 in a week
Now Im trying to call
One ring, two rings seven rings eight rings
Her mother picked up the phone
Like she at school and she dont stay here no more
I guess theres more good women than men percentage wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimized
I guess thats why she say she aint into guys
Focus on school full time to improvise
We ball til we fall
Hit the mall
After we hit dont call
Fill your lives with nothing but lies
So I would like to apologize
No no you cant stand right here and tell me
Everything is gonna be alright
Cuz until that real man stands up
Im gonna have to improvise
You cant stand right here and tell me
Everything is gonna be alright
Cuz until that real man stands up
Im gonna have to improvise
