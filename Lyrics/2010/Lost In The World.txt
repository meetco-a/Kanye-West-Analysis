[Justin Vernon - Bon Iver: Sample From "Woods"]
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
[Chorus]
I'm lost in the World, I'm down on my mind
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
down for the night
said she's down for the night
I'm lost in the World, I'm down on my mind
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
down for the night
said she's down for the night
[Verse 1]
You're my Devil, you're my angel
You're my Heaven, you're my Hell
You're my now, you're my Forever
You're my freedom, you're my Jail
You're my lies, you're my truth
You're my war, you're my truce
You're my questions, you're my proof
You're my stress and you're my masseuse
Mama-say mama-say ma-ma-coo-sah
Lost in this plastic life,
Let's break out of this fake ass party
Turn this in to a classic night
If we die in each other's arms we still get laid in our afterlife
If we die in each other's arms we still get laid
[Chorus]
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm lost in the World, I'm down on my mind
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
down for the night
said she's down for the night
Who will survive in America
Who will survive in America
Who will survive in America
[Chorus]
I'm lost in the world, I'm down on my mind
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
down for the night
said she's down for the night
I'm lost in the world, I'm down on my mind
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
down for the night
said she's down for the night
