Make me smile in my heart.
Ohh.
Why everything that's supposed to be bad make me feel so good

What's your addiction? Is it money? Is it girls? Is it weed?

She's got the same thing about me but more about us
She's coming over so I guess that means I'm on...
Make me smile.
Just let me peek now I mean damn I'm so curious
She's got a love so the lies and the lust is a rush
Time's of the essence I need you to be spontaneous
Roll up the doja, henny and c-c-c-cola.
Make me smile.
And I'm co-coming over, 'cause it's ne-never over.
Oh.
Why everything that's supposed to bad make me feel so good
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man I tried to stop man I tried the best I could
But...
Make me smile.
I see the emotion in your eyes that you try not to show
We get the closest when you high or you drunk or you blow
So I pour the potion so we could both get high as we could go
Then I'll get the lotion and do something to me when your thighs is exposed.
Make me smile.
There's no turning back now, I mean I don't mean to impose
Not now but right now I need you to undress and then pose
I'm into that now catch a vibrate when the doors get closed
Roll up the doja, henny and c-c-c-cola.
Make me smile in my heart.
Ohh.
And I'm keep' co-co-ming over, 'cause it's ne-never over.
Make me smile.
