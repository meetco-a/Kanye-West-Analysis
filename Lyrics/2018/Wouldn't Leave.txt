I don't feel that she's mine enough
God, I feel I couldn't have you whine enough
Butterfly in my wrist
You make me run out of my skin
And I don't feel like
And I know you and me
They say, "build your own," I said, "How, Sway?"
I said, "Slavery a choice." They say, "How, Ye?"
Just imagine if they caught me on a wild day
Now I'm on fifty blogs gettin' fifty calls
My wife callin', screamin', say, "We 'bout to lose it all!"
Had to calm her down 'cause she couldn't breathe
Told her she could leave me now
But she wouldn't leave
And I know you and me
When some things frees
Theres no such thing
We could wait longer than these
Yes you know, yeah, believe
We can run up on the top-top, yeah
And the sundress thing, ohhh
And I know you and me
Oh, don't bring that up,
That's gon' get me sentimental
You know I'm sensitiv
I got a gentle mental
Every time something happen,
They want me sent to mental
We got an incident but I cover incidentals
You want me working on my messaging
When I'm thinking like George Jetson
But sounding like George Jefferson
Then they questioning my methods then
If you tweakin' out my texts again then I don't get reception here
I got the mind state to take us past the stratosphere
I use the same attitude that done got us here
I live for now, I don't know what happen after here
I live for now, I don't know what happen after here
Plus, what was meant to be was meant to be
Even if, publicly, I lack the empathy
I ain't finna talk about it, 'nother four centuries
One and one is two but me and you, that's infinity
I don't feel that she's mine enough
God, I feel I couldn't have you whine enough
Butterfly in my wrist
You make me run out of my skin
(Run out of my skin)
And I don't feel like (uhh)
And I know you and me
(Love me or hate me)
For any guy that ever fucked up
(Love me or hate me)
Ever embarrassed they girl
(Love me or hate me)
Ever embarrassed they wife
(Gone when you miss me)
She told you not to do that shit (ohh)
She told you you's gon' fuck the money up
But you ain't wanna listen, did you?
Keep that same energy
Keep that same energy
Now you testing her loyalty
This what they mean when they say
For better or for worse, huh?
For every damn female that stuck with they dude
Through the best times
Through the worst times
This for you
And I know you and me
