Happened to be just like moments
Passing, in front of me so

Seems like streetlights glowing
Happened to be just like moments
Passing, in front of me so
I hopped in, the cab and
I paid my fair, see
I know my, destination
But I'm just not there
All the streetlights glowing
Happened to be just like moments
Passing, in front of me so
I hopped in, the cab and
I paid my fair, see
I know my, destination
But I'm just not there in the streets
In the streets

I'm just no there
