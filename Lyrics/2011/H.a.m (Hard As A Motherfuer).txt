It was all good just a week ago
Niggas feel theyselves
And then watch the throne drop
Niggas kill theyselves
What niggas gon' do ho?
This a new crack on a new stove
I'm in the two door, true that
Niggas tellin' me "You back?"
Like a nigga ever left up out this bitch, huh?
And if life a bitch, suck my dick huh?
And I bet she fucked the whole clique, huh
By the way nigga, you should fuckin' quit, nigga
Just forget it, you talk it, I live it
Like Eli I did it, jokes on you muthafucker and I get it
No paper ho, but you can have some more of me
Orgy, or are we speakin' methaphorically
Historically, I'm kickin' bitches out like pam, nigga
Goin' H.A.M. nigga, me and jigga
And a nigga still young, wanna have no kids
But I've been practicing with some actresses as bad as shit
Had a few white girls, asses flat as shit
But the head so good, damn a nigga glad he hit
Got 'em jumpin' out the building
Watch out below, a million out the door
I'm about to go H.A.M., hard as a muthafucker
Let these niggas know who I am
I'm about to go H.A.M., hard as a muthafucker
Let these niggas know who I am
Fuck y'all mad at me for?
You don't even know what I've been through
I play chicken with a Mac truck
Y'all muthafuckers woulda been moved
I swam waters with great whites
Y'all muthafuckers woulda been chewed
I hustle with vultures late nights
Y'all muthafuckers woulda been food
Fuck wrong with these dudes?
Try to walk around in these shoes
See the shit I saw growing up
And maybe you can take a peek at these boos
Niggas fantasize about the shit that I do daily like
These rappers rap about all the shit that I do really
I'm like really half a billi nigga, really you got baby money
Keep it real with niggas, niggas ain't got my lady money
Watch the throne, don't step on our robe
Bad enough we let you step on our glow
When my nephew died, daddy dead
Niggas took the price on my uncle's head
Nobody called the cops as my uncle bled
So I feel like I would like to know my uncle's bread
Bow down, brother pay homage
Don't spill hate all on my garments
Commes Des Gar√ßons, fuck you're fresh
Head shots nigga fuck your vests
Fuck the pig, no pork on my fork
Peace God, 'cause you know a nigga just went H.A.M.
Hard as a muthafucker, let these niggas know who I am
Yeah I'm 'bout to go H.A.M.
Hard as a muthafucker, let these niggas know who I am
Yeah I'm 'bout to go HAM
