Up from the ashes into the sky
Found a redeemer, how I survive
Voice of their mothers, Mary and Christ
Your light has healed me, blessed with new life
I could tell you, He could show you
God and Heaven shinin' on you
Through your message, now I know you
I come to you empty, free of my pride
(Ooh, ooh)
He ain't goin'
He ain't tellin' none
We ain't goin'
We ain't tellin' none
And I keep rolling
And I keep spillin' in the [?]
I come to you empty, free of my pride
Up from the ashes into the sky
Found a redeemer, how I survive
Voice of their mothers, Mary and Christ
Your light has healed me, blessed with new life
I could tell you, He could show you
God and Heaven shinin' on you
Through your message, now I know you
I come to you empty free of my pride
I come to you empty
