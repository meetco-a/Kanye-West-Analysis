[Intro: Ty Dolla $ign & Ant Clemons]
We began after the storm inside
Lay the land (Ah), it's just the morning light (Woo, woo)
Woo, woo, oh yeah

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Ant Clemons]
Woo-ooh, ooh-ooh
Switch your⁠, switch your attitude
Go 'head, level up yourself
This that different latitude
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Life too short, go spoil yourself
Feel that feel, enjoy yourself 'cause

[Refrain: Ant Clemons & Ty Dolla $ign]
We have everything we need (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, oh)
We have everything we need (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh)
We have everything we need (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, oh)
We have everything we need (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, woah)
We have everything we need

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
We began after the storm inside
Lay the land (Ah), it's just the morning light (Oh, yeah)

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Ant Clemons]
Switch my, switch my attitude
I'm so, I'm so radical
All these people mad at dude
This for who it matter to
What if Eve made apple juice?
You gon' do what Adam do?
Or say, "Baby, let's put this back on the tree" 'cause

[Refrain: Ant Clemons & Ty Dolla $ign]
We have everything we need (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, oh)
We have everything we need (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh)
We have everything we need (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, oh)
We have everything we need (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, woah)
We have everything we need

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
We began after the storm inside
Lay the land (Ah), it's just the morning light
