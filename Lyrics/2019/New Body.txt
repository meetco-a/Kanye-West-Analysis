Oh my God, Ronny
[Ty Dolla $ign:]
Can't wait to see your new body
Your Holy, Holy and new body
There's more to gain in your new body
So it's only fair to your new body, woah
[Kanye West:]
New walk, new talk
Who that, who this?
Who else you know this bad with two kids?
Nobody nowhere, ever gave you this
Nobody flew to Colombia, like you did
Trying the new dress out with the new drip
Buying a new bag, first one to get
Other than this, it's on the to-do list
And I get in fluent all by the influence
Old sins don't count
Old friends might bounce
Told the devil, "Get behind me, I ain't ever going out"
Start, the leaders tryna doubt
But we never going out
My body's soul, so who you dealing wit now?
This a new jig, got a party table at the Ruth Chris
All God's children take a group pick
Turn the flash off 'cause we too lit
You used to twerk to every-every song
You done partied every way, now you're very, very on
Spent it on a bottle like Christ on the phone
All glory be to God, Hallelujah, carry on
[Ty Dolla $ign:]
Can't wait to see your new body
Your Holy, Holy and new body
There's more to gain in your new body
So it's only fair to your new body, woah
Can't wait to see your new body
Your Holy, Holy and new body
There's more to gain in your new body
So it's only fair to your new body, woah
New body, you ain't working hard
But I gave my life to you, you deserve it all
Now if he calls you, I ain't perfect
I know sometimes I agree, but it's worth it
Tryna put my legs up, never give up
Only thing I'm tryna do is give that sin up
Look at the scoreboard, I love to show off
And if anybody step to you, then they too wrong
'Cause every last one, go ahead, return it
And if the price ain't what you asked for, every sermon
So I'm turning to Your commandments
'Cause I know all you do is give me strength, yeah
Can't wait to see your new body
Your Holy, Holy and new body
There's more to gain in your new body
So it's only fair to your new body, woah
