We are water
We are water
We are water
We are water
Purest water
Like a newborn daughter
Let your light reflect on me
Take the chlorine out of conversation
Let your light reflect on me
I promise I'm not hiding anything
It's water (Water)
We want water
Purest water
Like a newborn daughter
The storm may come
But we'll get through it because of your love
Either way, we crash like water
Your love, your love's water
Purest water, we are water
Let your light reflect on me
Take the chlorine out of conversation
I don't like these perfect discussions
But, we're made up of 90 percent water
We are water
We are water
Water, water, water
We are water
Water, water, water
We are water
We are water
Let your light reflect on me
Take the chlorine out of conversation
I know I might not be as perfect as Christ
But, we're made up of 90 percent water
We are water
We are water
Water, water, water
We are water
Water, water, water
We are water
We are water
Clean us like the rain of spring
Take the chlorine out of conversation
Let your light reflect on me
I promise I'm not hiding anything
It's water
We are water
Purest water
Like a newborn daughter
The storm may come
But we'll, but we'll get through it because of your love
Either way, we crash like water
We are water
Let your light reflect on me
Take the chlorine out of conversation
I might not be as perfect as Christ
But, we're made up of 90 percent water
We are water
We are water
Water, water, water
We are water
Water, water, water
We are water
We are water
We are water
Water, water, water
We are water
Water, water, water
We are water
We are water
We are water
We are water
We are water
We are water
So, we are, the purest
The purest father
Let your light reflect on me
Take the chlorine out of conversation
I know I might not be as perfect as Christ
But, we're made up of 90 percent water
We are water (We are water)
We are water (We are water)
The storm may come
But, we'll get through it because of your love
Either way, we crash like water
Your love's water
Water
