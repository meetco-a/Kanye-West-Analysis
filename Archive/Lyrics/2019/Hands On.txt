Just live to see the light
Hands on, hands-hands on
Hands on, hands on, hands on
Hands on, hands on
Hands on, hands-hands on
Cut out all the lights, He the light
Got pulled over, see the brights
What you doin' on the street at night?
Wonder if they're gonna read your rights
Thirteenth amendment, three strikes
Made a left, when I should've made a right
Told God last night, "I want life"
Told the devil that I'm going on a strike
Told the devil when I see him, on sight
I've been working for ya my whole life
Told the devil that I'm going on a strike
I've been working for ya my whole life
Nothing worse than a hypocrite
Change, he ain't really different
He ain't even try to get 'em permis'
Ask for advice and they diss them
Said I finna do a gospel al'
What have you been hearin' from the Christians?
They'a be the first one to judge me
Make it feel like nobody love me
They'a be the first one to judge me
Feelin' like nobody love me
Told people, God was my mission
What have you been hearin' from the Christians?
They'a be the first one to judge me
Make it feel like nobody love me
Make you feel alone in the dark and you're never seen a light
And you're never seein' home and you never seen the domes
I can feel it when I write, when I'm livin' in the right
And you only see the wrong instead of listenin' to the songs
Just to listen is a fight, but you booked me for the fight
It's so hard to get along if they only seen the slight from the love of religion
What have you been hearin' from the Christians?
They'a be the first one to judge me
Make it seem like nobody love me
I'm not tryna lead you to pieces
But if I try to lead you to Jesus
We can call halfway believers
Only halfway rest in peaces
Only if they knew what I knew of
I was never new, 'till I knew of
True and living God, yeah a true one
The truth of living God
(Someone pray for me)
