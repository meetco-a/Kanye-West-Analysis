All the teams I tore up
Ultrabeam out the sofa
Holy war wrong, couldn't fold the culture
Tryna keep my composure
While I scream out the chauffeur
I ain't mean, I'm just focused
I ain't mean, I focus
Pour the lean out slowly
Get his clean out the soda
Whole plug judged, they did the same thing to Noah (God)
Everybody need Yandhi
My cousin's mad at my auntie (Mad at my auntie)
You bought a crib out the country (Mad at me)
Try to miss and you miss me
Know me, they keep telling me to call for my pony
They want free, this is freedom
The realest, you can keep it
Show your friend when you greet her
I'm there when you need her
We know God, when you see him
Love God, you gon' need him
I'm there when you need her
Love God, you gon' see him
Love God, you gon' meet him
Don't you love God, won't you hug God
Got more, got more
Kanye brought the West
Kanye, Yeezy
Maybe just Ye
The slave name ain't the same name
The same name everybody saying
I've been in the game for four hundred years
If I can see 2019 to 12/8, 12/8
Can't hold like me
Hop out the boat like me
[?] are like me
[?] deal
Soft like me

If you woke, then wake up
Try to stomp, we make up
Stop killing and make up
Gotta shake this shit up
God's something they can't front
God's something they can't front
Stab your back, they can't run
Sound like something, we won
Ain't no walking up to me, nigga
We must have, we ain't greedy, huh
Something, something, nigga need me, huh
Told everybody, "They ain't see me, huh"
We ain't the product, we are the juice
We going wild, we staying loose
Home for the Zeus, we got the proof (Yeezy, Yeezy)
(Yeezy, Yeezy)
We the machine (Yeezy), we goin' through (Yeezy)
We like the we (Yeezy), y'all niggas you (Yeezy)
Hold up for you (Yeezy), you, you (Yeezy)
