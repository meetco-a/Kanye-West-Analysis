I need you, I want you to
Come to me, ecstasy (uh)
Ecstasy, ecstasy, (uh) ecstasy (uh)
Ecstasy, ecstasy, (uh) ecstasy (uh)
Ecstasy, ecstasy, (uh) ecstasy (uh)
Ecstasy, ecstasy, (uh) ecstasy (uh)
Ecstasy—

You got sick thoughts? I got more of 'em
You got a sister-in-law you'd smash? I got four of 'em
Damn, those is your sisters
You did somethin' unholy to them pictures
Damn, you need to be locked up
Nah, we need a bigger hot tub

Now let me see your back, back, back, back
Time to get the bag, bag, bag, bag
We don't throw stones, we throw stacks
That's why they goin' mad, mad, mad, Max
If you don't say your name then I won't ask
She got a smartphone, but a dumb ass
I thought of all of this on Ecstasy

You got sick thoughts? I got more of 'em
You remember bad bitches that you smashed? I recorded 'em
She said, "Fuck weed," 'cause she love X
If she suck seed, that's a success
If a girl cum, that's a fuck fest
And we gon' score 100 on this drug test

Now let me see your back, back, back, back
It's time to get the bag, bag, bag, bag
We don't throw stones, we throw stacks
That's why they goin' mad, mad, mad, Max
If you don't say your name then I won't ask
You got a smartphone, but a dumb ass
I thought of all of this on Ecstasy (perfect!)

Fuckin' 'round—whoop, scoop!
Whoopity-whoop
Whoopity-whoop, scoop-poop-woop-toop
Scoopity-whoop loot, looty-whoop-whoop
Ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstasy (uh, uh)

You got sick thoughts? I got more of 'em
Haaan? Scoop!
You see them escorts? I escorted 'em, scoopity-woot!
While y'all was trippin', I resorted 'em, whoop!
Then I kicked 'em out, I got bored of them, whoop!

Now let me see your back, back, back, back
It's time to get the bag, bag, bag, bag
We don't throw stones, we throw stacks
That's why they goin' mad, mad, mad, Max
If you don't say your name then I won't ask
You got a smartphone, but a dumb ass
I thought of all of this on Ecstasy
