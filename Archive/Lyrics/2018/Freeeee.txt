May I say something to you to give you a true knowledge of yourself and life?
Man in the full knowledge of himself is a superb and supreme creature of creation
When man becomes possessor of the knowledge of himself, he becomes the master of his environment

I don't feel pain anymore
Guess what, baby? I feel free (Scoop!)
Nothin' hurts me anymore
Guess what, baby? I feel free

I'm so complete in the mode
Guess what, baby? I feel free
And you know damn well
He lift me up every time that I fell
And set me free, yeah
Ah! You should quit your job to this
Hold up, let 'em politic, ooh
One day they hate you
Next day they love you
I'm still yellin' "Fuck 'em"
I could never trustâ€”

Free, I feel free
I feel free, I feel free

I don't feel pain anymore
Guess what, babe? I am free
Yeah, nothin' hurts me anymore
Guess what, babe? I am free

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Feelin' I'm out of my past life
Died and came back twice
Now I'm free

I don't feel pain anymore
Hmm, guess what, babe? I am free

I feel free, I feel free
I feel free, I feel free
