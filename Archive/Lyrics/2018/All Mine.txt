Yeah, you supermodel thick
Damn, that ass bustin' out the bottom
I'ma lose my mind in it, crazy that medulla oblongata
Get to rubbin' on my line
Get the genie out the bottle
Fuck it up, fuck it up
Pussy good, go and back it up
Pipe her up, I'ma pipe her up
Make her mine, I done fell in love
Juicy thing, make that pussy say
One more time, baby, do it big
Make it cry, come, go hold this shit
Yeah, you supermodel thick
Damn, that ass bustin' out the bottom
I'ma lose my mind in it
Crazy that medulla oblongata
Get to rubbin' on my lap
Get the genie out the bottle
If I pull up with a Kerry Washington
That's gon' be an enormous scandal
I could have Naomi Campbell
And still might want me a Stormy Daniels
Sometimes, you gotta back to boss up
I call that taking Corey Gambles
Find yourself up in the food court
You might have to enjoy your sample
All these thots on Christian Mingle
Almost what got Tristan single
If you don't ball like him or Kobe
Guarantee that bitch gonna leave you
Hey, time is extremely valuable
And I prefer to waste it
On girls that's basic
That's just some Ye shit
Right now let's do what we want
Let's have a threesome with you and the blunt
I love your titties
'Cause they prove I can focus on two things at once
Yeah, you supermodel thick
Damn, that ass bustin' out the bottom
I'ma lose my mind in it
Crazy that medulla oblongata
Get to rubbin' on my lap
Get the genie out the bottle
Get the genie out the bottle
Let me hit it raw like fuck the outcome
Ay, none of us would be here without cum
Ay, if it ain't all about the income
Ay, let me see you go ahead and spend some
Ay, if you driving round, here's some dri-fit
Ay, I'ma think that you the type to dry snitch
Hm, mhm, If I see you pull up with the three stripes
Ay, ay, I'ma fuck around and make you my bitch
Yeah, you supermodel thick
Damn, that ass bustin' out the bottom
I'ma lose my mind in it
Crazy that medulla oblongata
Get to rubbin' on my lap
Get the genie out the bottle
Get the genie out the bottle
