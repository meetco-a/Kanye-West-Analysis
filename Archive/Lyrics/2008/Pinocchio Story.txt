Wise men say (x3)
You'll never figure out real love (x3)
Its so crazy
I got everything figured out
but for some reason I can never find what real love is about
no doubt
everything in the world figured out but I can never seem to find what love was about
do you think I sacrifice real life
for all the fame, like flashing lights
do you think I sacrifice, a real life
for all the fame, and flashing lights
There is no Gucci I can buy
There is no Louis Vuitton to put on
There is no YSL that they could sell
to get my heart out of this Hell
and my mind out of this jail
There is no clothes that I could buy
that could turn back a time
there is no vacation spot I could fly
that could bring back a piece of real life
real life, what does it feel like?
I ask you tonight, I ask you tonight
What does it feel like, I ask you tonight
To live a real life
I just want to be a real boy
They always say Kanye, he keeps it real boy
Pinocchio story is, I just want to be a real boy
Pinocchio story goes to be a real boy
Its funny, Pinocchio lied and that's what kept him from it
I tell the truth and I keep running
Its like I'm looking for something out there trying to find something
I turn on the tv and see me and see nothing
What does it feel like to live real life, to be real
Not some persona on T.V that no one can really feel
Do you really have the stamina?
For everybody that sees you, they say "Wheres my camera?"
For everybody that sees you, they say "Sign the autograph"
For everybody that sees you crying and says you ought to laugh, you ought to laugh
I just want to be a real boy,
Pinocchio story goes, I just want to be a real boy
Pinocchio story goes...
And there is no Gepetto, to guide me, no one right beside me
The only one was behind me, I can't find her no more
I can't find her no more, I cant.
The only one that come out on the tour and stays
Back when I was living at home and this was all a big dream
And the fame will be got caught and the day I moved to L.A
Maybe that was all my fault, all my fault to be a real boy
Chasing the American Dream, chasing everything we seen, up on the tv screen
I went out, the Benz was left and the clothes was left, and the hoes was left you talk the hoes to death, you spend the doughs to death, and tell me what is left for a real boy?
They say, "Kanye you keep it too real, boy"
