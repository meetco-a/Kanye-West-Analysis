(Kanye)
I gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra Fly... For the
Day i die, I'ma touch the Sky...
Gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra Fly... For the
Day i die, I'ma touch the Sky
Back when they thought pink Colors'll hurt the R.O.C
Before Cam got the shit to pop
The doors is closed
I felt like Bad Boy's Street Team
I couldn't work the L.O.X
Now lets go...
Take em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that UHaul Van
Any pessimist I aint talk to them
Plus I aint have no Phone in my apart- a-ment(apartment)
Let's take em back to the club
Least about an Hour I stand on Line
I just wanted to dance
I went to Jacob an hour after I got my advance
I just wanted to shine
Jay's favorite Line "Dawg in due Time"
Now he look at me Like " damn, dawg you what I am"
A hip hop legend
I think i died in the accident
'cause this must be heaven!
I gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra Fly... For the
Day i die, I'ma touch the Sky...
Gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra Fly.(yeah)...For the
Day i die, I'ma touch the Sky
Now let them High a i i i i. la la la la la la (top of the world baby, on top of
the world!)
(Repeats 2X)
Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when slick rick got the shit to pop
I do anything to say i got it
Damn those new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K. West beats
Me and my girl spent a buffet at KFC
Dawg i was having nervous breakdowns
Like man these niggas that much better then me?
Baby, Im going on a Aeroplane
And i don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it
Things became diffrent
Any girl i cheated on
Sheets is skeeted on
Couldnt keep it at home
Thought i needed a Nia Long
Im trying to right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs help me right this song
NOW
I gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra Fly... For the
Day you die, you gon touch the Sky you gon touch the sky Baby Girl!
Testify, come up in the spot looking extra Fly... For the
Day you die.You gon touch the SKY!
(Lupe Fiasco)
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Guess whos on Third
Lupe steal Like Lupin the Third
Here like ear til I'm beer on the curb
Peach fuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Lets slow it down like were on the syyurrp
Bottle shaped body like Mrs Butter worth
But, before you say another word
Im back on the block like im man on the street
Im trying to stop lying (Lion) like I'm Mum Ra
But im not lying when im laying on the beat
En Garde--Touche' Lupe cool as the unthawed
But i still feel possessed as a gun charge
Come as correct as a Porn star
In a fresh pair of steps in my best foreign Car
So, i represnt the first
Now let me end my verse right where the horns
Are Like Unhhh
I gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra Fly... For the
Day you die, you gon touch the Sky you gon touch the sky Baby Girl!
Testify, come up in the spot looking extra Fly... For the
Day you die.You gon touch the SKY!
We back at home baby, Yeah

Im, Im sky high (Repeats 4 times)
Sky Ungh Sky high
Im Im Sky high
Yeah keep it rolling ...Yeah!
