Uhh, yeah And I heard 'em say
Nothin's ever promised tomorrow, today
From the Chi, like Tim, its the Hardaway
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today,
Can I at least get a raise
On the minimum wage?
And I know the government administered AIDS
so I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allah o Akhbar jus' throw him some hot cars
Cause the things we see on the screen is not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where I'm from the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars without seeing cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars
I know it, uhh
And I heard 'em say
Nothin's ever promised tomorrow, today
And I heard 'em say
Nothin's ever promised tomorrow, today
(but we'll find a way)
And nothing lasts forever but be honest, babe
Tough, but it might be the only way
They say people in your life are seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas gun-clappin' and keep to squeezin'
And gran' keep prayin' and keep believin'
In Jesus, and one day that she'll see him
'Till then, walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive, I feel him breathin'
Claimin' money is the key, so keep on dreamin'
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My Aunt Pam can't put them cigarettes down
So now my lil' cousin smokin' them cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now?
I can't figure it out
But I'm stickin it out, uhh
uhh
And I heard 'em say
Nothin's ever promised tomorrow, today
And I heard 'em say
Nothin's ever promised tomorrow, today
But we'll find a way
And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe
It hurts, but it might be the only way
With every worthless word we get more far away
And nothin's ever promised tomorrow, today
And nothin' lasts forever, but be honest, babe
It hurts, but it may be the only way
